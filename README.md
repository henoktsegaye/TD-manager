# TD Manager 

**Helps you manage TD(Technical Debit) right from your extension.**
List the `TD` comments in all files of the projects and show them in a list.
You can find the `TD` explorer view in the `Activity Bar` of VSCode. Which will show you the list of all `TD` comments in your project.
## Features

Add a `//TD:` comment to your code and it will be added to the TD list.

- `[label]` - Label for the TD ( you can use `//TD: [label]` )
- `(level)` - Level of the TD ( you can use `//TD: [label] (level)` ) - this will show the level of TD
- ` message ` - Message for the TD ( you can use `//TD: [label] (level) - message` ) - this will show the message of TD

###  Example
You can merge similar `TD` issues with a label. If you have the same label in multiple files, you can see them merged in analytics or labels ( in the future - WIP)

- `// TD: example`
- `// TD:[example] - this is an example of a TD`
- `// TD:[example](3) - this is an example of a TD`

When you have a label and a level , TD-manager would help you see the analytics in the future.

Analytics is not here yet but it will be soon.
